### **Deployment Strategy**

This document summarizes the discussion regarding the deployment of the frontend and backend components of the application.

**1. Single Platform Deployment (Recommended for Simplicity):**

*   It is possible and often recommended to use a single Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider to host both the frontend (React dashboard) and the backend (FastAPI application).
*   **Benefits:** Simplifies deployment, monitoring, and management; potentially lower latency between frontend and backend.

**2. Recommended PaaS for Testing (Free Tier):**

*   **Render** is a suitable PaaS option with a free tier for testing and development.
*   **Render's Free Tier Offers:**
    *   Free Web Services (for FastAPI backend): Services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity, suitable for testing.
    *   Free Static Sites (for React frontend): Always-on.
    *   Free PostgreSQL Database: An option if not using Supabase.

**3. Backend Deployment Considerations:**

*   Our FastAPI backend requires a persistent server. Platforms like Netlify are primarily for static frontends and serverless functions, not ideal for our current backend architecture.
*   Suitable alternatives for persistent Python backends include Render, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or self-managed VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean).

**4. Frontend Deployment Considerations:**

*   Netlify remains an excellent choice for deploying just the React frontend due to its generous free tier and ease of use for static sites.
*   However, if using a single PaaS like Render, the frontend can also be hosted there.

**5. Transition to Production:**

*   While free tiers are excellent for development and testing, production-ready backends typically require moving to a paid plan to ensure consistent performance, higher resources, and always-on availability.
